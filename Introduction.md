### History ###

**Vikuit** born with the end of the 2010. We wanted to create a new community,http://www.hispavox.org, and we were searching a social engine, easy and cheap.

We look at some other initiatives such as SAAS platforms as Ning and hosting solutions, but they weren't fitting our needs. We like the Google's Appengine approach and we found a project from 2009 called dmo at Berlio's, from the guys of http://es.debugmodeon.com/ . We love it, was easy to maintain, build over the technologies that we were looking at. Was a good foundation, and we started to improve it adding several features such as internationalizations and new design, fresh libraries, recoded some existing parts...  We used best of bread technologies, such as ckeditor and jquery. That's the born of Vikuit.

### Aim ###

The aim of vikuit is to fill the void between social payment's networks as Ning and systems based hosting. Keep the advance features of Google's Appengine, and why not, it's cheap approach.   The two main Vikuit's guidelines are:

  1. Easy to install, easy to administer, easy to develop and play.**Thought for users started but not advanced.**
  1. Improve what means a social community. To innovate in aspects as voice or authentication. Always without compromise the first point :)

**Download, play and extend it !** Everyone is welcome to participate and contribute. Everyone is welcome to use it !
